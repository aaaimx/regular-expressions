# Literal Matches

A **literal match** is when a given character or a string is exactly matched.

For example, in order to find the word "my" in a text, we will use the plain text "my".
surrounded by slashes to emphasize it as a Regular Expression;/**my**/.

The regex /**my**/ will match the literal word "**my**" in the given text.
 ```js
RegEx: /my/
String: "SoloLearn is a great place to learn to code with my friends"
```

Another example: /Bob/ matches "**Bob** Marley", "**Bob** Dylan" and "me and **Bob**by McGee". It will not match "Robert".

## Multiple matches
By default, most regex engines will return only the first occurrence of a match. But there are different ways which enable to obtain a list of all matches.
For example, in JavaScript, the optional **g** (*global*) flag returns an array of all the matches.

## Case sensitivity
By default, regular expressions are case sensitive.
So, /**my**/ will not match "**My**".
However, you can force it to be case insensitive.
For example, in JavaScript, this can be done using the **i** flag.

> A regular expression searches for an occurrence **anywhere** in a given string. It does **not** requiere the entire string to match.
