# Matching Special Characters

There may be cases when you need to match special characters, like metacharacters.  
For example, search for a **dollar sign** ($) or a **bracket**.  
The solution is to **escape** the metacharacters by proceding them with a **backslash**.
```js
RegEx: /1 \+ 3 \* \(2 \+ 2\)/
String: "1 + 3 * (2 + 2)"
```

In the example above we escaped the **+** (plus sign), **\*** (asterisk) and brackets to match them literally.

> The backslash is obviusly a metacharacter, too. If you need to match a backslash, you should escape it using another backslash, \\\\.
