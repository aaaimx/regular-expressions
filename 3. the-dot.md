# The Dot

The **dot** (.) is one of the most common metacharacters.
The dot matches **any single character** (except line breaks).

Let's say we want to find all the words that start with the word "code" but may end differently.
For example:
"My original **code** was saved in the file **code1.js** and the updated version is in **codeFinal.js** but I later changed **code1.js** to **code1.old.js**"

The regex /**code**./ (note the **dot** at the end of "code") will match all the words that contain "**code**":
```js
RegEx: /code./
String: "My original code was saved in the file **code1**.js and the updated version is in **code**Final.js but later I changed the **code1**.js to **code1**.old.js"
```

Note that the dot notation is selecting both, characters and digits.

> The dot (.) is similar to the command line \*, which is used to match any character.
